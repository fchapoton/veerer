Veerer
======

veerer is a Python module to deal with Veering triangulations and
their associated flat structures.

To install the module you need Python (version 2 or 3) and
pplpy (see https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy). It is advised
to use it inside SageMath (http://www.sagemath.org/). The
installation is done via pip.

Example
-------

    sage: from veerer import *
    sage: T = ColouredTriangulation([(0,1,2), (-1,-2,-3)], [RED, RED, BLUE])
    sage: F = T.flat_structure()
    sage: F.plot(vertical_train_track=True)
    sage: F.plot(horizontal_train_track=True)
