Veerer
======

veerer is a Python module to deal with Veering triangulations and their
associated flat structures.

To install the module you need Python (version 2 or 3).

Computations involving polytopes are only available if the Python module
pplpy is available (see https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy).

Additional features are available if this module is used inside SageMath
(http://www.sagemath.org/).

The installation is done via pip.

Example
-------

    >>> from veerer import 
    >>> T = ColouredTriangulation([(0,1,2), (-1,-2,-3)], [RED, RED, BLUE])
    >>> T.is_core()
    True

If you are in SageMath you can obtain flat structures and plots

    >>> F = T.flat_structure()
    >>> F.plot(vertical_train_track=True)
    >>> F.plot(horizontal_train_track=True)

Testing
-------

To run the SageMath doctests, install the module (with pip) and run

    $ sage -t --force-lib veerer/
